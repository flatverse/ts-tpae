0.5.0:
    - accidentally published 0.1-0.4
    - decided to use a Reference interface to handle links from things, parts, and properties
    - simplified a lot of the initial implementation to focus on TP+props definition structure. Not runtime or edit time utility
    - NEXT TODO: write some actions to help figure out what runtime classes/interfaces/structures are needed - so you can then use in the physics package
